# Jeff-Interpretted-Language-JIL-
Development of an interpretted language for use in future projects, but mostly as a learning exercise. 

## Welcome!

What is this? I am embarking on a journey to develop a general purpose interpretted language in c++, mostly for educational purposes. I have many goals
for doing this. One goal is to just become more familiar with modern and optimized c++ and OO principles to improve my craft. Another (albeit lofty) goal
is to create a fun and engaging open-source community working to build something fun. Looking to have other contributors, and be welcoming to people who want 
to start contributing to an open source project. 

## Where to start?
This project is built using CMake. I will add in build details shortly, but I am currently developing this on both MacOS, and Windows. There will be some pains getting your build environment set up
however I will eventually put some installation and build instructions up. 

## Dev Tasks
Current Development tasks can be found [at the Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/UHF9wIE2/jil-dev)

The Discord is going to be built up as well, in hopes of boosting the community engagement. I first need to actually get contributors first! There are many opporunities for contributing, so just message me on here!
